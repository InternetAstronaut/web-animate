# WebAnimate
#### WebAnimate is based on Wick Editor!

 is a browser-based hybrid animation/coding environment for making interactive things for the web, heavily inspired by similar tools such as Flash, HyperCard, and Scratch. It was developed in response to a growing need for such a tool for the modern web. Wick is currently live at [www.WickEditor.com](http://wickeditor.com/), come check it out sometime!

# How to contribute to WebAnimate
Want to help us make WebAnimate? There's plenty to do, we'd love your help.

### Create tutorials
WebAnimate *will soon* need tutorials! If you're interested in making text or video tutorials, contact [`@noobfield` on the Wick Editor Forums!](https://forum.wickeditor.com/u/noobfield/summary), especially if you want to make non-english tutorials! The [Github Wiki](https://github.com/InternetAstronaut/web-animate/wiki) is a good place to start if you want a template.

### Report bugs and submit bug fixes
Found a bug? Add it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/InternetAstronaut/web-animate/issues). You can also look at existing bugs in the issue tracker. If you're just getting started, check out the bugs tagged as `small-bugs` - these are smaller fixes that you can do to get acquainted with the codebase.

### Suggest features and give feedback
Have an idea for a new feature, or want something specific changed or fixed? Post an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/InternetAstronaut/web-animate/issues) so we can discuss it and make it happen.

### Make things and help promote WebAnimate
If you're a creator that wants to support WebAnimate, one of the most helpful things to do is to is to make sure that it's clear that you made your project with WebAnimate. Maybe slap [the mascot](https://github.com/zrispo/wick/blob/master/site/img/flashy.png) *please wait until i decide a mascot is needed!* on your project with a link to [wickeditor.com](http://wickeditor.com/)? *it will be on my website soon, this does not link to anything like it.*

## How to help/hack this old fart of a website so we can make it good.
* Clone or download and unzip this repo
* Open terminal in the newly made `web-animate` folder and start an HTTP server:
  * `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2)
  * `python -m http.server` (Python 3)
* OR if you have npm installed, you can get [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server), which is faster
  * `npm install http-server -g` to install
  * `http-server` to start
* OR if you have npm installed, and reloadphobia, use:
  * `npm install -g live-server` to install live-server
  * `live-server` to start, once you change a file, the website reloads!
* Open a browser window, and go to `http://localhost:8000/`

Need help? Feel free to contact [`@noobfield` on the Wick Editor Forums!](https://forum.wickeditor.com/u/noobfield/summary) (that's me). *OR, make a help-wanted issue!*
